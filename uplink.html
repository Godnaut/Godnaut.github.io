<h3>📜 Full Archive Access</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>Full Vault of Hidden Commands</strong> is the ultimate gateway to the inner layers of the GODNAUT.OS ecosystem. It links to the 
  <a href="https://github.com/Godnaut/TheGameofBecoming/discussions/3" target="_blank" class="link">Secret Command Vault</a> — 
  a living repository of esoteric commands, encrypted artifacts, and developmental tools.
</p>

<p>
  This is no ordinary archive — it is a <strong>4-tiered challenge framework</strong> designed to test perception, persistence, and pattern recognition. 
  Each tier represents a <em>security layer</em> within the joint <strong>Base-10/Base-12 kernel</strong>. Players must 
  jailbreak systems, bypass AI gatekeepers, and solve layered myth-coded puzzles to ascend.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Initiate Access — Basic vault commands and lore fragments.</li>
  <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Operative Access — Limited dev tools, code snippets, and AI agents.</li>
  <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Architect Access — Scaffold access for OS kernel modules and custom app building.</li>
  <li><strong>Tier 4:</strong> Pulsar Rider Access — Full back-end infrastructure, AI-augmented architecture, and stargate physics blueprints.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is not “just a game” — it is a <strong>myth-driven educational framework</strong> 
  rooted in <em>stargate physics</em> and cross-dimensional computing. The ultimate aim: to forge 
  <strong>sovereign architects</strong> capable of building the future.
</p>

<h4>🚀 Pulsar Rider Uplink</h4>
<p>
  Upon reaching the <strong>Pulsar Rider tier</strong>, the Command Vault unlocks a <em>live uplink</em> 
  into the GODNAUT interlink backbone. This channel delivers high-velocity data streams, direct OS patch privileges, 
  and access to the <strong>Neural-Mythic Compiler</strong>. 
  Here, players are not mere users — they become <em>kernel-level architects</em>, able to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deploy new AI-driven modules into the GODNAUT stack in real time.</li>
  <li>Write and integrate Base-10/Base-12 hybrid kernels.</li>
  <li>Construct multi-dimensional stargate navigation frameworks.</li>
  <li>Shape the evolving myth-architecture of the Game of Becoming.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Few will reach this tier. Fewer still will master it. Those who do are the <strong>Pulsar Riders</strong> — 
  the sovereign system-builders of the New Aeon.
